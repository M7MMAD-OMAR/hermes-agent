/**
 * PIN BOOK — one review spanning several pages.
 *
 * A pin lives in the page it was placed on and dies with it, so the app has
 * always been the durable side. The book is that durable side made explicit:
 * a bucket of pins per page, so walking from the home page to a product page
 * and back is an ordinary thing to do in the middle of a review rather than a
 * way to lose the comments you already wrote.
 *
 * Before this, everything the panel held was replayed into whatever page
 * loaded next — so page A's pins landed on page B, resolved against nothing,
 * and came back marked detached. Bucketing fixes the write side; the seed
 * filter in `preview-pins.ts` fixes the read side, using the guest page's own
 * `location` rather than what the pane believes it is showing.
 *
 * Pure and dependency-free, like pin-block.ts, so it can be tested without a
 * page.

 * review into two buckets for no reason the user could ever see. Anything more
 * clever — dropping the query, folding `/` and `/index.html` — would merge
 * pages that really are different, which is the worse mistake.
