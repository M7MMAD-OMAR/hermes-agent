"""Arabic typography defaults for HerWork deliverables.

Cairo is the house font for anything that contains Arabic — the office
suite default (Calibri) falls back to an ugly Arabic rendering. These
helpers set Cairo on docx / pptx / pdf output, including the
complex-script font slot that Arabic text is actually shaped from.

For docx and pptx only the font NAME is embedded — the operating system
resolves it, so those work anywhere Cairo (or a fallback) is installed.
PDF generation via reportlab embeds the font file itself, so
``register_pdf_font`` locates the TTF across Linux/macOS/Windows font
directories and tells you to install Cairo if it can't.

Usage:
    from arabic_style import style_docx, style_pptx, register_pdf_font, FONT

    style_docx(doc)                      # after building the Document
    style_pptx(prs)                      # after building the Presentation
    register_pdf_font()                  # then canvas.setFont(FONT, size)

    to visual order before it is drawn. That is what ``arabic_reshaper`` and

    The trap is that a font is NOT required to carry that block. Cairo's

    "▯لمبيعا▯": reportlab asked for a codepoint the font never claimed and
    drew .notdef, silently, in a finished deliverable.

    So every shaped character is checked against the registered font's own
    cmap and, when absent, folded back to its canonical letter (NFKC:
    U+FE8D -> U+0627). The base letters are all present, and for the forms
    that go missing the two glyphs are visually identical anyway — an
    isolated alef IS an alef.
