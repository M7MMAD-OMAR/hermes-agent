"""Import-graph budget for the headless backend boot.

A profiled `hermes serve` (isolated HERMES_HOME, `-X importtime`) spends
**1310 ms of its 1770 ms** spawn→``HERMES_BACKEND_READY`` window importing
modules — 74% of the boot. The desktop cannot show a window until that
sentinel lands, so anything that joins this import graph is paid by every
launch on every machine, forever.

The two largest components are load-bearing and deliberately left alone:

  · ``hermes_cli.web_server`` (368 ms) — the app itself, 317 routes.
  · ``tui_gateway.server`` (250 ms) — imported before the bind for the
    flush-on-SIGTERM handlers (#94724). It redirects ``sys.stdout`` →
    ``sys.stderr`` at import time, which is why
    ``_write_machine_sentinel_line`` writes to fd 1 directly (#96282).
    Deferring it past the READY write would change stdout state exactly
    when the desktop is parsing fd 1 for the port sentinel — a boot the
    desktop declares dead, not merely a slow one.

What this test guards is the *third* category: modules that join the graph
by accident. Measured marginally (importing them on top of everything a
headless serve already needs), today's CLI-parser-registration tail costs
43 ms — not the 152 ms its cumulative profile time suggests, because it
shares most of its dependencies with serve. That margin is too small to
justify restructuring argparse registration; it is not too small to be
worth stopping from growing.

Deliberately counts modules rather than milliseconds: wall-clock import
time varies with page cache, CPU governor and disk, and a timing assertion
here would flake in CI while telling you less. A module count is exact, and
growth in it is what actually drives the milliseconds.
