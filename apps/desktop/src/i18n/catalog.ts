/**
 * Locale catalog — English static, everything else on demand.
 *
 * The five message trees total ~908 KB of source and built into a single
 * 699 KB chunk that `index.html` modulepreloaded on every launch. A user
 * reads one language, so four fifths of that was always dead weight on the
 * cold boot path.
 *
 * English stays static because it is both `DEFAULT_LOCALE` and the fallback
 * arm of `translateFrom` — every miss in every other locale resolves through
 * it, so it is genuinely needed before first paint. The other four are
 * dynamic imports, fetched when a locale actually becomes active.
 *
 * This does not introduce a new flash of English. `I18nProvider` already
 * starts at `DEFAULT_LOCALE` and switches only after its async
 * `configClient.getConfig()` resolves — the locale chunk is fetched on that
 * same transition, so the swap the user sees is the one that already existed.
 *
 * Sync reads that arrive before the chunk lands (`translationsFor`) return
 * `undefined`, which `translateFrom` already handles by falling back to
 * English. That fallback is load-bearing here, not incidental — do not
 * "simplify" it away.
