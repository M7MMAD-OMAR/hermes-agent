/**
 * PIN BLOCK — how a batch of pins reaches the model.
 *
 * This is the send-time expansion of a `pins` composer attachment, the exact
 * counterpart of `reviewCommentBlock` in chat-runtime.ts: the chip is a
 * summary, and the real payload only materialises when the message is sent.
 *
 * Deliberately plain text in a fenced block rather than a tool call or a JSON
 * envelope. The RFC on #90654 makes the point for element context and it holds
 * here: "no fabricated structure crosses into the model; it's plain context
 * text." A pin is a human sentence about a place on a page, and the model
 * already reads prose about code perfectly well.
 *
 * Pure and dependency-free so it can be unit-tested without a page.
