/**
 * COMPOSER RELAY — attachments made in a window that has no composer.
 *
 * Every desktop window is its own renderer with its own composer store, so
 * `addComposerAttachment` only ever fills the composer of the window that
 * called it. That is right for every window EXCEPT the popped-out Browser,
 * which has no composer at all: there the click succeeded, the chip landed in
 * an atom nothing renders, and the user saw nothing happen.
 *
 * Only that one window relays. `isAuxiliaryWindow()` looks like the right test
 * and is not — it also covers the secondary session window and the HUD, and
 * both of those are full app renderers with a real composer of their own
 * (see the comments in `store/windows.ts`). Relaying from one of those posts
 * the chip to the PRIMARY window, which is not the window the user is looking
 * at: the same invisible success, one layer further away.
 *
 * Same shape as `session-sync.ts`: a BroadcastChannel, never delivered to its
 * own poster, with the primary window as the only listener. The one addition is
 * an acknowledgement — see `relayComposerAttachment`.
