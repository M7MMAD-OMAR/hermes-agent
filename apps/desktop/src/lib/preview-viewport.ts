/**
 * PREVIEW VIEWPORT — emulating a device inside the preview pane.
 *
 * The pane is whatever width the user dragged it to, which is the one width
 * nobody's site is designed for. This lets the page be told it is 390px wide on
 * a wide monitor, or 1440px wide inside a narrow rail, so a layout can be
 * checked where it actually breaks.
 *
 * WHY `enableDeviceEmulation` AND NOT A CSS TRANSFORM. A transform on the
 * <webview> element is simpler and needs no IPC, but real mouse input then has
 * to be mapped through that transform before it is routed into the guest, and a
 * <webview> guest is not an ordinary transformed box. Emulation is Chromium's
 * own device mode: the element is untouched, the guest is told its size, and
 * input is mapped by the same code that maps it for DevTools.
 *
 * Measured on Electron 40 rather than assumed:
 *   - the guest reports the emulated size and its media queries flip;
 *   - INJECTED input (`sendInputEvent`, the agent's `drive_preview` path)
 *     arrives in WIDGET pixels and Chromium divides it by `scale` — verified at
 *     three scales, and independent of the element's size. So a caller holding
 *     guest coordinates has to multiply by `scale` on the way in. That same
 *     division is what makes a real mouse land where it visually appears, which
 *     is why the pins engine needs nothing.
 *   - sizing the element to `device × scale` and passing the same `scale` makes
 *     the emulated page fill the element exactly, with no letterboxing.
 *   - `mobile` is what makes a phone preset mean anything: without it a 390px
 *     viewport is just a narrow desktop window that ignores <meta viewport>.
 *
 * Pure and dependency-free so the arithmetic can be tested without a browser.
