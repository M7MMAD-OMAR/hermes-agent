 *  mostly title: on a narrow strip the status spent more width than the thing
 *  it was labelling, and the title it pushed out is what tells two running
 *  chats apart. One glyph keeps the distinction and gives the width back.
 *
 *  The glyphs carry no language — the word they stand for lives in the tooltip,
