/**
 * ONE BROWSER PER CONVERSATION.
 *
 * The rail was one strip holding every chat's pages, so three projects' tabs
 * piled into one row. Each conversation now shows its own browser.
 *
 * HIDDEN, NOT FILTERED, and that is the whole design constraint. The pane
 * mirror registers from `$dockedPreviewTabs`; dropping a tab out of that list
 * calls `removeTreePane`, which destroys the pane and the live page inside it —
 * so scoping the list would tear down whatever the OTHER conversation's agent
 * was in the middle of driving and reload it on the way back, losing its
 * scroll, its form and its login. Hiding leaves every pane registered and
 * mounted; it only stops the strip from drawing the tab.
 *
 * The second constraint is a scar: filtering this mirror by workspace mode once
 * dropped the pane out of Bot Mode entirely, so `openPreview` ran and a clicked
 * link looked like a no-op. Anything a PERSON opened is unowned and stays
 * visible from everywhere.
