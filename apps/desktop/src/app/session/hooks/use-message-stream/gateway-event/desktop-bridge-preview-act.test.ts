/** `preview.act.request` — the drive_preview bridge.
 *
 *  Two shipped bugs had no coverage here at all, and both were invisible from
 *  the agent's side because the tool answered with a plausible sentence rather
 *  than failing loudly:
 *
 *  1. The gate compared the requesting session against the PRIMARY view's
 *     runtime. This bridge mounts once (wiring.tsx), so every tile — including
 *     every ⌘T tab — was refused permanently while the user was looking
 *     straight at it, and told "the session the user is looking at".
 *  2. `url` and `full` were on the wire but missing from the forwarded field
 *     list, so `navigate` reported "navigate needs a url" for a url it had
 *     been given, and `elements full=true` quietly answered with a delta.
