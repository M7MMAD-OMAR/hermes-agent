/** The preview engine, loaded on demand so ~25KB of page-injectable source stays

 *
 *  In dev that lazy chunk is also a trap. The browser caches a dynamic import by
 *  URL for the life of the page, so this bridge would hand every action to
 *  whichever build of the engine loaded first, and no edit to it — or to the
 *  overlay whose source it stringifies into the page — would reach the guest
 *  until the whole window reloaded. Asking for a fresh copy is more reliable
 *  than trusting hot-update propagation to reach a module nothing statically
 *  imports; the dev server stamps the dependency URLs it has invalidated, so a
 *  fresh engine pulls a fresh overlay down with it.
 *
 *  The literal path is what a bare specifier can't be here, and it has to track
 *  this module's real location — hence the fall back to the static import, which
 *  is also the only branch production keeps, `import.meta.hot` being stripped
 *  there along with everything it guards. */
