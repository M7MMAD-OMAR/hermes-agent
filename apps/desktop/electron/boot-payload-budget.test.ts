/**
 * Cold-boot payload budget.
 *
 * `index.html`'s `<script type="module">` + `<link rel="modulepreload">` set is
 * everything the renderer fetches and compiles BEFORE the first paint. It is
 * also the easiest thing in the app to regress by accident: one static import
 * from a boot-path module silently drags a multi-MB library onto the entry
 * graph, and nothing fails — the app just starts slower for everyone, forever.
 *
 * That has already happened and been fixed twice, each time by rerouting the
 * library behind a dynamic `import()`:
 *
 *   · shiki (19 MB, every grammar + theme) → `shiki-block.tsx` / `LazyShiki`
 *   · katex (253 KB, the slowest single chunk) → `lib/use-math-plugin.ts`
 *
 * Measured before the katex fix: 105 chunks / 5.97 MB. After: 104 / 5.72 MB.
 * After the shared-module groups (10 Sept 2026): 14 / 5.51 MB.
 *
 * The two assertions below are deliberately different in kind:
 *
 *   · The size ceilings are a coarse ratchet. They exist to make an unexplained
 *     jump visible in review, not to police every kilobyte. Raising them is a
 *     legitimate outcome of a legitimate feature — do it with a note saying
 *     what grew.
 *   · The forbidden-library list is a hard invariant. Those chunks are large
 *     enough that reaching them from the entry graph is always a mistake, and
 *     the fix is always the same: route the importer through a dynamic
 *     `import()` the way the two modules above do. Do NOT relax this to make a
 *     build pass.
 *
 * Skipped when `dist/` has not been built (unit-test-only runs, fresh clones).
 * A build is what produces the thing under test; asserting against a missing
 * or stale one would just be noise.
